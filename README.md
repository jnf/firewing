# Firewing
I'm learning Elixir/Phoenix by building a small app to help folks catalog their collection of MtG cards.

## The plan
Build a CRUD app with enough complexity to allow me to explore...
- Phoenix's opinions on MVC and CRUD, plus Octo as an ORM
- Background job processing with [Toniq](https://github.com/joakimk/toniq)
- Integrating with a [third party API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)
- [My First Channel](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/channels) in the form of a realish-time activity feed

## Standard Documentation
To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
